# Sunny Land demo

![Sunny Land preview](sunny-land-preview.png)

This is a port to Phaser 3 of the [Sunny Land demo made by Luis Zuno](https://ansimuz.itch.io/sunny-land-pixel-game-art).

To make this demo, we used the [Phaser Editor 2D version 3](https://phasereditor2d.com). It is a good example of how to use the Tilemap support in the Scene Editor, the User Components and the Animations Editor.
